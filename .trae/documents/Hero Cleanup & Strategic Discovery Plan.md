I will remove the redundant "Meet G-Agent" feature card from the Hero section, as the main headline now covers this. I will then ask a series of questions to guide the next phase of development.

### **Phase 1: Clean Up Hero Section**
*   **Remove:** Delete the entire `div` block containing the "Meet G-Agent" feature highlight (lines 114-134 in `Hero.tsx`).
*   **Verify:** Ensure the layout remains balanced after removal.

### **Phase 2: Discovery & Strategy Questions**
I will present a structured list of questions to the user to clarify the product direction, covering:
1.  **Core Functionality:** How does G-Agent interact with the user? (Chatbot, Dashboard, CLI?)
2.  **Visual Identity:** Should the site lean darker/cyberpunk or stay clean/enterprise?
3.  **Content Strategy:** Do we need case studies, testimonials, or a technical deep dive?
4.  **Integration:** Is this a real product requiring backend integration, or a high-fidelity prototype?
5.  **User Journey:** What is the primary call-to-action flow?
