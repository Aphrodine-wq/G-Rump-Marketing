I will implement the requested changes to the Hero, Claude section, and Footer status.

1.  **Hero Section (Frowny Face)**:
    *   **File**: `components/Logo.tsx`
    *   **Action**: Add an interactive click handler to the logo.
    *   **Effect**: Clicking the face will toggle it from a **frown** to a **smile** (`isHappy` state). I will also add a subtle animation/color shift to make it feel responsive and "cool".

2.  **Claude Section**:
    *   **File**: `components/ClaudeSection.tsx`
    *   **Action**: Update the "Anthropic Intelligence" badge to explicitly say **"Powered by Claude Opus 4.5"** as requested.

3.  **NIM Inference Status**:
    *   **File**: `components/Footer.tsx`
    *   **Action**: The status is currently hardcoded to "Degraded". I will update it to **"Operational"** and change the indicator color from yellow to green.
