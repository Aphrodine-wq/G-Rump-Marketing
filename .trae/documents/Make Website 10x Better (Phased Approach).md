I will upgrade the remaining sections of the website in 4 distinct phases to match the new "Dark Tech Core" aesthetic and "10x" the overall quality.

### **Phase 1: The "Hero" Refactor (First Impression)**
*   **Goal:** Transform the `Hero.tsx` into a cinematic, dark-mode entry point that seamlessly flows into the "Tech Core" sections.
*   **Changes:**
    *   **Dark Mode Switch:** Invert the background to deep black (`#050505`) to match the new `SystemArchitecture` and `NvidiaSection`.
    *   **"Cyber" Grid:** Replace the subtle light grid with a glowing, perspective-warped grid (retro-futuristic).
    *   **Typography:** Upgrade the "Architecture as Code" headline with a "shimmer" animation.
    *   **Interactive Terminal:** Add a mini floating terminal in the hero that types out the value prop automatically.

### **Phase 2: The "Bento" Grid Upgrade (Features)**
*   **Goal:** Make `Features.tsx` feel like a high-tech dashboard.
*   **Changes:**
    *   **Unified Dark Theme:** Update all cards to use the `bg-white/5` glassmorphism style used in the NVIDIA section.
    *   **Interactive Cards:**
        *   **"Performance" Card:** Add a real-time counter that ticks up/down.
        *   **"Agents" Card:** Add a "scanning" radar effect over the agent avatars.
        *   **"Security" Card:** Add a pulsing "Shield" animation.

### **Phase 3: Social Proof & Trust (TrustedBy & Testimonials)**
*   **Goal:** Move away from generic "logo soup" and "white cards."
*   **Changes:**
    *   **`TrustedBy.tsx`:** Convert to a "Tech Stack Integration" ticker. instead of just logos, show code snippets or "Connected" status indicators for each tool (e.g., "React: Connected", "AWS: Active").
    *   **`Testimonials.tsx`:** Redesign as "Engineer Reviews" – dark cards that look like GitHub comments or PR reviews, complete with "LGTM" badges and commit hashes.

### **Phase 4: The "Command Center" Footer**
*   **Goal:** Turn the footer into a useful navigation terminal.
*   **Changes:**
    *   **`Footer.tsx`:** Switch to dark mode. Add a "Server Status: Operational" indicator with a green pulsing light.
    *   **`CTA.tsx`:** Merge visually with the footer to create a massive bottom-of-page "Launchpad."

### **Execution Plan**
I will execute these sequentially, starting with Phase 1 (Hero) as it sets the tone for the entire site.
